							1/25/2021: The Profiles section has now been added, the Dashboard has been updated to
							show some basic PitCanasta user statistics, and several other code refactors.

						<p>
							1/20/2021: Several 'Admin' features were added, along with several code refactors.

						<p>
							1/15/2021: The basic {{ env('APP_NAME') }} web application framework is complete
							(security, user authentication and basic user profile information).&nbsp; The next step in
							developing this	web application is for us to create a 'Game Table Profile' page where users can
							create multiple gaming id's.&nbsp; Shortly after that we will create a chatroom!&nbsp; For
							an overview of things to come, please click on the '{{ env('APP_NAME') }}' logo in the upper
							left part of this window.
