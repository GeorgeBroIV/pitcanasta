								Once complete this web application will host a fully functioning online multi-player canasta card
								game that is similar in feel to Yahoo's (now decommissioned) Canasta game site.
								<br><br>
								We will first develop a chatroom and message board for friends and new players to chat and post
								messages.&nbsp; Next we will develop the game lobbies which will have their own chat section and
								show the card tables.  Later we will develop the actual game tables for 2 and 4 player canasta
								games, similar in style the Yahoo Canasta card tables that we grew to know and love.
								<br><br>
								Future developments may include rated and non-rated games, multiple id's with id-specific
								avatars and ratings, table kibitzing, the ability to go invisibile, ability to block chat
								messages from bothersome players, ability to create public or private tables, game leagues, etc
								.&nbsp; Once this is complete and operational, other card games may follow depending on player
								interest.
								<br><br>
								A lot of functionality will come from ideas and suggestions from people like you!&nbsp;
								So if you have any thoughts please post a message on the 'Features Wish List' message board once
								this is available.
